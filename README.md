In this project, I performed automated API testing using the public Airport Gap API. The goal was to validate the functionality and reliability of the API.
Key features of the project include:
-Assertions and automatic validations: Verified HTTP responses, status codes, and key data using Postman assertions.
-JavaScript scripting: Utilized custom Pre-request and Test scripts to automate tests and handle more complex logic, such as validating data across different endpoints.
-Collection variables: Implemented collection variables to efficiently and flexibly manage airport names in the requests, allowing data reuse across multiple tests.
